# Keel 

## What is Keel?

Keel is the all-in-one backend platform that gives you everything you need to build your product.  

üî• A fully-managed relational database  
üî® Scalable infrastructure  
ü¶Ñ A great local development experience  
ü§ù Flexible and customisable API's  
üëª Authentication & Permissions  
üåç Multiple environments  
‚ö°Ô∏è Configuration and secret management  
üßê Observability  
üöÄ Git-based deployments  

Keel is currently in private beta, [join the waiting list](https://keel.so/) for access to the platform. In the meantime you can run your Keel projects locally without an account using the CLI

## Getting started


### Installing the CLI via Homebrew

The best way to get started with Keel is to install the CLI via Homebrew:

```bash
$ brew tap teamkeel/homebrew-keel
$ brew install keel
```

If the CLI has installed correctly, then `keel --version` will output the latest version number:

```bash
$ keel --version
```

### Creating a new project
Creating a new project with the CLI is easy! You can create a new Keel project locally by running:

```bash
$ mkdir my-keel-project && cd my-keel-project
$ keel init
```

This will create a skeleton project containing a `keel.schema` file, a `.gitignore` and a `.keelconfig.yaml` file.

_Run `keel init --help` to see all of the available options for `init`._

### Setting up your editor

Keel has created a handy [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teamkeel.vscode-keel) that accelerates your development experience by providing syntax highlighting, autocompletions and validation of schemas.

### Your very first Keel schema

To create your first Keel schema, follow our [Quickstart Tutorial](https://docs.keel.so/get-started/tutorial#the-keel-schema).

### Running your Keel app

Now that you've created your first Keel schema, you can start using your APIs by starting the Keel development server:

```bash
$ keel run
```

_Run `keel run --help` to see all of the available options for `run`._

If everything has been successful, you should see something like this in your terminal:

You can now interact with your APIs at the URLs displayed. For more next steps, take a look at our [documentation](https://docs.keel.so/).


Have fun with your new Keel backend!

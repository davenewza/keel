/*
This is iteration zero of a GraphQL server that will consume a proto.Schema at
run time, and implement the GraphQL contract dynamically by building an
"executable schema" on the fly programmatically using the GraphQL SDK.

This iteration is based on the official graphql-go/graphql introductory example.
It does only a Query operation, the schema construction is hard coded, and the
resolvers work by accessing a trivial in-memory data structure.

As it stands, it serves two purposes:
1) To illustrate the 101 of how you use the SDK to compose an executable schema.
2) For me to probe and better understand the minimum necessary coupling between
   the components that is required for it to work. See comments within to explain what
   I mean by that.

	// The implementation of the resolver for the "user" field in the query, does a lookup
	// in our psuedoDatabase, and will find and return an object of arbitaryType. That will
	// completely satisfy the resolve repsonsibility it seems. I.e. the returned object
	// will not be scrutinized for comformance with the GQL userType specified at that stage.
	// It seems it will then later recurse to resolvers for each field therein (by definition until
	// it reaches a scalar field) - and then resolve the scalar field automatically by finding a field
	// in the arbitraryType object that has a JSON tage of the right name (and has the right type).

// Summary of the minimum binding requirements discovered.
//
// If you define a GQL type that has a field with the name "xxx", and include that
// field in a query http request, then the resolver for that field, will look in the
// arbitrary object it is given, for a field whose JSON tag is also "xxx".
// If the object doesn't have such a field - the resolver shown above survives but
// populates the field in the response with a nil.
//
// This happens at the level of the graphql.Do() level - nothing to do the
// JSON encoding of the http response.
//
// So it seems the JSON tag is part of the graphql.Do() contract?
// It maybe it would also be satisfied with the field actually having the right
// name - but that means the filed would then have to be exported, which clashes
// with the lower case GQL field name convention.

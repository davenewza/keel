# Keel

Keel is the all-in-one platform that solves the backend puzzle by combining all the essential technology and tools your team needs to build a business that thrives.

🔥 A fully-managed relational database  
🔨 Scalable infrastructure  
🦄 A great local development experience  
🤝 Flexible and customisable API's  
👻 Authentication & Permissions  
🌍 Multiple environments  
⚡️ Configuration and secret management  
🧐 Observability  
🚀 Git-based deployments  
🎟️ Pub/Sub  
💼 Cron jobs 

Keel is currently in private beta, [join the waiting list](https://keel.so/) for access to the platform. In the meantime you can run your Keel projects locally without an account using the CLI.

## Installation

The best way to get started with Keel is with the CLI. 

### Dependencies

First, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Docker](https://docker.com/) as they are required to run Keel. 

### Installing the CLI

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
$ npm install --global keel
```

If the CLI has installed correctly, then `keel --version` will output the latest version number:

```bash
$ keel --version
```

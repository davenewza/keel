# Contributing

This repo is setup so that all contributors follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) conventions when writing commit messages.

__You will not be able to merge your PR without following these conventions.__

### Important:
- Please ensure that you have read and understood the Contributing guidelines before creating a PR.
- This project is currently focused on bug fixes, nit fixes, documentation, and tests.
- **We are NOT accepting pull requests for new features or refactor contributions at this time.**

### How to file a bug report.
To file a bug report, please head over to the [issues tab](https://github.com/teamkeel/keel/issues) of this repository, create a new issue and in the issue template please select bug report.
### A short primer on conventional commit messages

Prefix your commit messages with:

- For minor version bumps: `feat: some commit message`
- For patches / fixes: `fix: some commit message`
- For major bumps (note the `!`): `fix!: a major / breaking change`

## Note

Keel is currently pre-release (semver < 1). _Do not commit any major releases using conventional commits to bump the version to v1 until we have decided that this is the case_

## Development

### Nix

We use [nix](https://nix.dev/) to manage our development environment. To install
nix on MacOS run:

```sh
$ curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

Once you have nix installed you can start a nix shell by running `nix-shell` in
the root of the repo. The first time you run this it will install all the
required dependencies so might take a while to run, but subsequently should be
fast. When developing in this repo always start by starting a nix-shell.

### Docker

You also need Docker (for runnning Postgres) which needs to be
[installed separately](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).
Once installed the Docker daemon needs to be running, which you can check by
running:

```sh
$ docker ps
```

### Installing project dependencies

Running `make install` will install project level dependencies.

### Setting conventional commits git hook (Optional)

This repo follows
[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), which
means commits must be written in a certain way. If you want you can run
`make setup-conventional-commits` to install a pre-commit hook which will check
your commit messages as you make them.

### Running Go tests

To run tests first make sure you have running Postgres using Docker:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Then use `make test` to run the tests.

```sh
# run all tests
$ make test

# run all test in the schema package (and all sub-packages)
$ make test PACKAGES=./schema/...

# A specific test from the integration package
$ make test PACKAGES=./integration RUN=TestIntegration/built_in_actions
```

### Running JS tests

There are units tests in each of the JS packages in the `./packages` directory.
In each of these directories you can run `pnpm run test` but to run all the
tests from all the packages you can use the make command `make test-js`.

### Other useful make commands

- `make lint` - lint Go code
- `make testdata` - re-generate fixture data (check the diff carefully after
  doing this)
- `make proto` - re-generate Go code in the `./proto` package (run this after
  changing the `.proto` file)

### Using the CLI in development

```bash
go run cmd/keel/main.go [cmd] [args]
```

### Configuring a private key in development

The `-private-key-path` argument on the run command lets you pass in the path
to a file containing a private key in PEM format. This may be useful if you
need to perform development or testing with signed tokens.

```bash
go run cmd/keel/main.go run -private-key-path private-key.pem
```

You can generate a private key in PEM with `openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 2048`
or using some online [RSA key generator](https://travistidwell.com/jsencrypt/demo/index.html).


### Building from source

You can build the CLI by running:

```bash
make build
```

To then use the built CLI binary you can run:

```bash
./bin/keel validate -f ...
```

---

## Testing

Keel has a built-in testing framework that allows you to test the functionality
of the Keel runtime end-to-end.

Complete documentation and examples for the `@teamkeel/testing` package can be
found [here](/testing/package/README.md).

### Generating new schema test cases

There is a handy helper script to generate the relevant test case files if you'd like to write a new test case for something in the schema / validation rules:

```
sh ./scripts/new-test-case.sh test_case_name
```

This will generate:

- A blank `schema.keel` file
- An `errors.json` file where you can assert what errors you are expecting

### Updating test cases

If you have made a change to error message copy, then you can run `make testdata` and all of the test case JSON files will be updated to the latest copy.

### A note on test cases

Naming convention for test cases should describe the units you are testing in a hierarchical manner. Test cases covering validations should begin with `validation_` for example, and subsequent fragments should describe which validation is being tested.

If a test case is complex, or the name itself doesn't adequately describe what it is testing, then either reconsider the naming, or consider adding a `description.md` file into the directory where the test case lives to provide more colour.

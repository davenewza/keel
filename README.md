# Keel

Keel is the all-in-one platform that solves the backend puzzle by combining all the essential technology and tools your team needs to build a business that thrives.

üî• A fully-managed relational database  
üî® Scalable infrastructure  
ü¶Ñ A great local development experience  
ü§ù Flexible and customisable API's  
üëª Authentication & Permissions  
üåç Multiple environments  
‚ö°Ô∏è Configuration and secret management  
üßê Observability  
üöÄ Git-based deployments  
üéüÔ∏è Pub/Sub  
üíº Cron jobs 

Keel is currently in private beta, [join the waiting list](https://keel.so/) for access to the platform. In the meantime you can run your Keel projects locally without an account using the CLI.

## Getting started

The best way to get started with Keel is with the CLI. 

### Dependencies

First, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Docker](https://docker.com/) as they are required to run Keel. 

### Installing the CLI

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
$ npm install --global keel
```

If the CLI has installed correctly, then `keel --version` will output the latest version number:

```bash
$ keel --version
```

### Creating a new project

Creating a new project with the CLI is easy! You can create a new Keel project locally by running:

```bash
$ mkdir my-app && cd my-app
$ keel init
```

This will create a skeleton project containing a `keel.schema` file, a `.gitignore` and a `keelconfig.yaml` file.

_Run `keel init --help` to see all of the available options for `init`._

### Setting up your editor

Keel has created a handy [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teamkeel.vscode-keel) that accelerates your development experience by providing syntax highlighting, autocompletions and schema validation.

### Your very first Keel schema

To create your first Keel schema, follow our [Basic Tutorial](https://docs.keel.so/tutorial#the-keel-schema).

### Running your Keel app

Now that you've created your first Keel schema, you can start using your APIs by starting the Keel development server:

```bash
$ keel run
```

_Run `keel run --help` to see all of the available options for `run`._

If everything has been successful, you should see something like this in your terminal:

You can now interact with your APIs at the URLs displayed. For more next steps, take a look at our [documentation](https://docs.keel.so/).

Have fun with your new Keel backend!
